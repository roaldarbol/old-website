<!-- Starting out with a figure looks great, so we're automatically starting with the image from the preamble.
Good places to look for open source images are: 
* Good images, MANY trackers: https://unsplash.com/ 
* Poor images, few trackers: https://search.creativecommons.org/  -->

![](/assets/img/{{ page.img }})
*Credit the copyright holder here - html works too.*
<!-- The italicised text will render as the figure caption. -->

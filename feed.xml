<p>I have been so lucky to have secured PhD funding from the <a href="https://www.sussex.ac.uk/sensation/index" target="blank">Leverhulme Doctoral Scholarship Programme</a> at University of Sussex. That means that I’ll move (back) to Brighton for the coming 3-4 years.</p>

<p>It will be an immensely exciting journey for me, both personally and scientifically - and something I am really looking forward to.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-happen-on-this-blog">What will happen on this blog?</h2>
<p>And so, I decided to start this blog to document the journey. 
My idea right now is to write about life as a PhD student broadly: The science, the issues and the personal stuff. I’m thinking that some posts will be nerdy, targeted at fellow students and researchers, some will be trying to communicating scientific topics to a wider audience, and some will probably be mainly for my mom (<em>Hi Mom!</em>). 
As I am not hugely active on social media, I guess this will be kind of my own personal Facebook without all the cats and memes.</p>

<p>But for now, in this post, I’ll elaborate a bit on why I’ll be in Brighton of all places on Earth.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-i-end-up-here">How did I end up here?</h2>
<p>The road has been long and gnarly. But I’ll keep it to relatively recent events. In 2016/17 I lived in Brisbane, Australia where I worked in a few labs at University of Queensland. Here my passion for science as a whole grew immensely, and I had some of my very best academic ideas during this time. It also meant I became somewhat alienated from pure human research, which always in the end revolved around medical questions. Meanwhile I was trying to unify ideas from information theory, plant biology, evolutionary neuroscience, and from different branches of neuroscience; essentially I became obsessed with deriving <em>general principles</em> that applied to every type of brain or information processing organ in any living organism.</p>

<p>At the time I worked with <a href="https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/1850" target="blank">Prof. Tim Carroll</a>, who saw where I was going and urged me along. He introduced me to the incredible book by Prof. Peter Sterling and Prof. Simon Laughlin, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/principles-neural-design" target="blank">Principles of Neural Design</a>. If you are a neuroscientist and have not read this amazing book I cannot recommend it highly enough.</p>

<p>Then after returning to Denmark to study a MSc in Human Biology (in contrast what I just mentioned above, but I wasn’t accepted into the MSc in Biology), and for my Masters project I knew the direction I wanted to move in: <em>Away</em> from human, medical work. So I contacted Simon Laughlin who unfortunately no longer was running a lab - instead I got hold of his former post doc Dr. Jeremy Niven, who was running his <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/lifesci/nivenlab/" target="blank"><em>Laboratory of Evolutionary Computational Neuroscience</em></a> at University of Sussex, Brighton, somewhere, England. And so half a year prior to beginning I visited Jeremy to assess whether this could be a place for me. And in short, I returned my mind brimming with questions, ideas, curiosity and excitement. And so it happened that I landed there in the first place.</p>

<p>During my masters project I learned a lot. And I was challenged a lot - in the good way. A good example is this: When I arrived, Jeremy asked me what I wanted to do… for my project… that is, which animal, which question, what kind of setup - I essentially had to think, derive, plan and perform my very own project (of course with help as needed). But it is a great examplification of the kind of trust and academic freedom I was allowed, or encouraged to pursue in the lab. And <em>that</em> is exactly why I wanted to stay for my PhD, with Jeremy and all the other great curious minds and affecionate people at Sussex.</p>

<h3 id="how-am-i-funded">How am I funded?</h3>
<p>But one thing is to <em>want</em> to go back, a whole other issue is to find funding for such an endeavour. And especially to find funding which could allow me to work independently and develop my own framework of ideas. However, I was incredibly lucky that there was a call from the <a href="https://www.sussex.ac.uk/sensation/index" target="blank">Leverhulme Doctoral Scholarship Programme</a> - and that I was one of the lucky few who were offered a scholarship.</p>

<p>So a bit about the scholarship. There were especially two things which I found super exciting about this source of funding:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It comes from the Leverhulme Foundation, a foundation which explicitely supports only non-medical research. It means that I do not feel the pressure of justifying my work with ridiculous postulates of potential translational aspects of the research (though this sort of pressure might come from elsewhere).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The programme is of such an interdisciplinary nature; it supports research within the arts, within consciousness, and within various branches of the neurosciences, both experimental and theoretical. It means that not only is it possible to extend our work across disciplines and to learn completely new topics - it is highly recommended and encouraged to do so. I get the sense that it is the sort of programme that also encourages original thoughts and ideas, knowing that it may not directly translate into publications and citations straight away. For my application I derived and planned my very own project, which still at this stage I think is atypical and worked to my advantage I think. I’ll explain much more about it in a later post.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>And so I don’t think I could have ended in a much better situation for a PhD. And I hope I will continue to develop original ideas and think independent thoughts even once the pressure is on.</p>]]></content><author><name>Mikkel Roald-Arbøl</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="PhD" /><category term="Science" /><category term="Neuroscience" /><category term="Biology" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In September I'll begin my PhD journey at University of Sussex in the group of Prof. Jeremy Niven, the Laboratory of Computational Evolutionary Neuroscience.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">SportsMechanist</title><link href="https://roald-arboel.com/projects/sportsmechanist/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="SportsMechanist" /><published>2020-07-26T19:17:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-07-26T19:17:00+00:00</updated><id>https://roald-arboel.com/projects/sportsmechanist</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://roald-arboel.com/projects/sportsmechanist/"><![CDATA[<p>SportsMechanist is a project inspired by my coaching career. In elite sports we are always looking for improvements and in athletics these improvements are either of physical or technical nature - I’ll come back to that. I prefer to root my coaching decisions on objective criteria, whether its for planning a strength program or deciding how to change an athletes technique. For physical qualities there exists a plethora of options for doing this whether the outcome is strength, power, velocity, endurance - the gadgets are there, they’re relatively cheap and they are universal between sports. Foundation laid when it comes to planning for physical qualities.</p>

<p>However, technical ability is much harder to quantify. An much more so when you compete in a niche sport. Are you a golfer, a baseball player, or a long distance runner, then you’re covered - but when you’re not the only option is qualitative assessment, relying on the coaches eye. And don’t get me wrong: Coaches are <strong>good</strong> at this! It’s what they do. But just as technology changed our way of planning physical training, so it has the potential to do so in the sphere of technique. Until now, in order to obtain relevant kinematic data in athletics you have to compete at the World Championships Final, partake in a scientific study or perhaps you’re lucky enough to have access to the German Olympiastützpunkte - and most athletes are not.</p>

<p>And there you have the <em>need</em> that forced me to develop a <em>solution</em>. 
The premise is simple: Coaches are not programmers or technicians, and shouldn’t have to be. They should be great <strong><em>coaches</em></strong>!
So I wanted to make it easy and accessible: Record a video from a single camera and have it analysed.</p>

<p>So I set out to write some software which could calculate all the relevant numbers and output them in a readable format to assure it becomes a valuable tool. After 100’s of hours that project is now reality - it is not the end point yet though. It still needs me or a collegue to do a few hours of work before the report is done, something which I hope to eliminate. Ultimately, probably years out in the future I hope this could become an affordable solution to get quantitative feedback between or even during training sessions, perhaps even an app-based solution - but even now, I’m very proud of what it has become.</p>

<h1 id="why-virtual-reality">Why virtual reality?</h1>
<p>I think the brain is incredible. Not just the human brain, but any brain really. An organ dedicated to processing information, enabling animals to sense, move and adapt. How did they evolve? <em>Why</em> did they evolve?</p>

<p>Why am I saying this? Well, because I am a neuroscientist at heart, this is a neuroscientific project, and virtual reality only becomes valuable seen in this light.</p>
